# extract_images

A Rust utility that extracts background images from Windows 10/11 Content Delivery Manager assets and saves them to your Desktop with organized naming.

## Description

Windows 10/11 stores wallpaper and background images in a hidden directory. This tool finds those images, copies them to your Desktop in a new folder called `processed_backgrounds`, and renames them sequentially as `image_1.jpg`, `image_2.jpg`, etc.

## Features

- üñºÔ∏è Extracts Windows background images from system assets
- üìÅ Creates organized folder structure on Desktop
- üè∑Ô∏è Sequential naming for easy browsing
- üîÑ Overwrites previous extractions (cleans up old files)
- üìä Shows progress and file count

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or 11
- Rust toolchain (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))

### Build from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tembocs/extract_images.git
cd extract_images
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Simply run the executable:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

Or if you've built the binary:
```bash
./target/release/extract_images
```

The program will:
1. Check for existing `processed_backgrounds` folder on Desktop
2. Delete it if it exists (to ensure fresh extraction)
3. Create a new `processed_backgrounds` folder
4. Copy and rename all images from Windows assets directory
5. Display the number of files copied

## Output Location

Images are saved to: `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\processed_backgrounds\`

## Technical Details

The program extracts images from:
`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets`
